      <h2>Risks</h2>
      <p>
        Blood donation is safe. New, sterile disposable equipment is used for
        each donor, so there's no risk of getting a bloodborne infection by
        donating blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most healthy adults can donate a pint (about half a liter) safely,
        without health risks. Within a few days of a blood donation, your body
        replaces the lost fluids. And after two weeks, your body replaces the
        lost red blood cells.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>How you prepare</h2>
      <h3>Eligibility requirements</h3>
      <p class="topSpace">
        To be eligible to donate whole blood, plasma or platelets, you must be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In good health.</li>
        <li>
          At least 16 or 17 years old, depending on the law in your state. Some
          states allow legal minors to donate with parent permission. While
          there's no legal upper age limit, policies may vary between individual
          donor centers.
        </li>
        <li>At least 110 pounds (about 50 kilograms).</li>
        <li>Able to pass the physical and health-history assessments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Eligibility requirements differ slightly among different types of blood
        donation.
      </p>
      <h3>Food and medications</h3>
      <p class="topSpace">Before your blood donation:</p>
      <ul style="padding-bottom: 10px">
        <li>Get plenty of sleep the night before you plan to donate.</li>
        <li>
          Eat a healthy meal before your donation. Avoid fatty foods, such as a
          hamburger, fries or ice cream.
        </li>
        <li>Drink plenty of water before the donation.</li>
        <li>
          Check to see if any medications you are taking or recently took would
          prevent you from donating. For example, if you are a platelet donor,
          you must not take aspirin for two days prior to donating. Talk to a
          member of your health care team before you stop taking any medications
          in order to donate blood.
        </li>
        <li>Wear a shirt with sleeves that can be rolled up.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>COVID-19 concerns</h3>
      <p class="topSpace">
        The virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hasn't been
        shown to be transmitted through blood transfusions. However, the U.S.
        Food and Drug Administration suggests waiting to donate blood for at
        least 10 days after a positive diagnostic test for COVID-19 without
        symptoms or for at least 10 days after symptoms of COVID-19 have
        completely gone away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies but didn't have a
        diagnostic test and never developed symptoms can donate without a
        waiting period or having a diagnostic test done before donation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you get a nonreplicating, inactivated or mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine
        — the only forms of the vaccine currently approved in the United States
        — you can donate blood without a waiting period.
      </p>
      <h3>During the procedure</h3>
      <p class="topSpace">
        You lie or sit in a reclining chair with your arm extended on an
        armrest. If you have a preference for which arm or vein is used, tell
        the person who is collecting your blood. A blood pressure cuff or
        tourniquet is placed around your upper arm to fill your veins with more
        blood. This makes the veins easier to see and easier to insert the
        needle into. It also helps fill the blood bag more quickly. Then the
        skin on the inside of your elbow is cleaned.
      </p>
      <p>
        A new, sterile needle is inserted into a vein in your arm. This needle
        is attached to a thin, plastic tube and a blood bag. Once the needle is
        in place, you tighten your fist several times to help the blood flow
        from the vein. First, blood is collected into tubes for testing. Then
        blood is allowed to fill the bag, about a pint (about half a liter). The
        needle is usually in place about 10 minutes. When your donation is
        finished, the needle is removed, a small bandage is placed on the needle
        site and a dressing is wrapped around your arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another method of donating blood becoming increasingly common is
        apheresis. During apheresis, you are hooked up to a machine that can
        collect and separate different parts of your blood, such as red cells,
        plasma and platelets. This process allows more of a single component to
        be collected. It takes longer than standard blood donation — typically
        up to two hours.
      </p>
      <h3>After the procedure</h3>
      <p class="topSpace">
        After donating, you sit in an observation area, where you rest and eat a
        light snack. After 15 minutes, you can leave. After your blood donation:
      </p>
      <ul style="padding-bottom: 10px">
        <li>Drink extra fluids.</li>
        <li>
          Avoid strenuous physical activity or heavy lifting for about five
          hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you feel lightheaded, lie down with your feet up until the feeling
          passes.
        </li>
        <li>Keep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours.</li>
        <li>
          If you have bleeding after removing the bandage, put pressure on the
          site and raise your arm until the bleeding stops.
        </li>
        <li>
          If bruising occurs, apply a cold pack to the area periodically during
          the first 24 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider adding iron-rich foods to your diet to replace the iron lost
          with blood donation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Contact the blood donor center or your health care provider if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Forgot to report any important health information to the blood
          donation center.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have signs and symptoms of an illness, such as a fever, within several
          days after your blood donation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Are diagnosed with COVID-19 within 48 hours after donating blood.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p class="topSpace">
        Your blood will be tested to determine your blood type and your Rh
        factor. Blood type is classified as A, B, AB or O. The Rh factor refers
        to the presence or absence of a specific antigen — a substance capable
        of stimulating an immune response — in the blood. You'll be classified
        as Rh positive or Rh negative, meaning you do or don't carry the
        antigen. This information is important because your blood type and Rh
        factor must be compatible with the blood type and Rh factor of the
        person receiving your blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your blood will also be tested for bloodborne diseases, such as
        hepatitis and HIV. If these tests are negative, the blood is distributed
        for use in hospitals and clinics. If any of these tests are positive,
        the donor center notifies you, and your blood is discarded.
